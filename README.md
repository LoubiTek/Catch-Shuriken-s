# Catch-Shuriken-s
Processing 3 | 2D Game Project

Official processing site: https://processing.org/

Explanation and commentary: <br/>

After learning the beginning of a game previously. (Prototype: TestDevApp). <br/>
I wanted to design another project here: <br/>

Goal: You must catch the shuriken that falls from the top of the screen. <br/>

Again, the structure is not OOP! <br/>
Much easier (for me) and long to set up at the code level. <br/>

That said I would like one day to learn this concept in order to improve my future projects and save more time. <br/>

How to compile:
- Click on clone and download then download zip.
- Cut / paste on desktop
- Extract the zip
- Click on the Catch-Shuriken-s-master folder and move the Catch-Shuriken-s-master folder to your desktop
- Run Catch-Shuriken-s.pde, prompting you to create a new folder. Click Ok
- Close the application
- Cut / paste all .pde files into the new create folder name "Catch-Shuriken-s". As well as the data folder!
- Click on the Catch-Shuriken-s folder and then restart Catch-Shuriken-s.pde
- Execute and play

Have Fun and Enjoy!
